# RFM Analysis using Python

RFM Analysis is a concept used by Data Science professionals, especially in the marketing domain for understanding and segmenting customers based on their buying behaviour.

Using RFM Analysis, a business can assess customers: **recency** (the date they made their last purchase), **frequency** (how often they make purchases) and **monetary** value (the amount spent on purchases)

Recency, Frequency, and Monetary value of a customer are three key metrics that provide information about customer engagement, loyalty, and value to a business.
